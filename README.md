# Lark-Calculator
me using lark for the first time: why tf does it take like 69 lines of code to make a parser?
jokes aside, as the name suggests, it uses lark (earley) to parse input from the shell (when are you going to make a scripting language? :shipit:)

### run
1. have lark installed, that's it.

2. run that shit from vscode (btw i'm a terminal vim user) or terminal cuz it's a psuedo shell:
`./main.py` (unix)

`python3/python main.py` (windows)
